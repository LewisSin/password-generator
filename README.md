# Secure Key Vault

## Introduction
Hey everyone, this week we've got a cool project to tackle! We're building a password generator app that's going to run right in the browser. This app is super useful for creating random passwords based on criteria we choose, which is pretty handy for keeping all our accounts secure without having to fry our brains trying to come up with strong passwords on our own.

## Features
- **Customizable Passwords:** You can make your password as tough and complex as you want by mixing in special characters, numbers, and both upper and lower case letters.
- **Responsive Design:** Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or desktop, this app's going to look great and work smoothly.
- **User-Friendly UI:** We've kept things simple and clean so you can get your password without a headache.

## How It Works
1. **Open the App:** Just load it up in your browser, no installation needed.
2. **Choose Your Criteria:** Decide on the length of your password and whether you want to include special characters, numbers, and/or upper and lower case letters.
3. **Generate Password:** Hit the generate button, and boom! You've got yourself a strong, random password.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (with a bit of media query magic for responsiveness)
- Vanilla JavaScript (because sometimes, simple is better)

## Special Characters
For those wondering about the special characters, we're using the OWASP Foundation's list of recommended characters for secure passwords. You can check out their list [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters) if you're curious.

## Conclusion
Hope this helps you keep your online accounts safe and sound. Happy coding, and let's make something awesome!
